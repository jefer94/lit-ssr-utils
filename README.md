# Lit SSR API

Lit API to implement SSR to projects that do not use Javascript.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies by running: `bun install -D`.
3. Start the project by running: `npm start`.

## Usage

You can do an HTTP call, but this does not have authentication yet, you must adapt this code to your case, if you use Google Cloud Functions or something like that you would need to implement an authentication.

```HTTP
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  html: '<my-component />'
  dependencies: [{ code: '...', ext: 'ts' }]
}
```

The handler is decoupled, you should write a lambda function using `import { renderLitElement } from 'utils/renderLitElement.ts'`. Don't forget to protect this endpoint, anybody should inject a code inside your server.

Don't forget to import [`@lit-labs/ssr-client/lit-element-hydrate-support.js`](https://lit.dev/docs/ssr/client-usage/#loading-@lit-labsssr-clientlit-element-hydrate-support.js) in your HTML to add hydrate support (issue [#4472](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/4472)).
